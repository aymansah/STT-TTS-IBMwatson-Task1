# STT-TTS-IBMwatson-Task1

this repository is about Speach to text and text to speach functionality

in STT: I used to packages. the first one is Speach Recognition, which has lots of methods to recognize speach such as google, ibm watson and others. I used IBM watson. the other package is pyaudio since we are using a microphone, make sure if you have multiple mics setup in your machine to use the default one. There is a way to select prefered mic for STT, but for our purposes we use the default.

in TTS: we will install one package which is ibm-watson. which will allow us to synthezise text to speach. I used the text file generated by the STT.py to synthezize mp3 file in the TTS.py.

both output files are saved, please check them in the onedrive link below, or download the repository.

Thank you
